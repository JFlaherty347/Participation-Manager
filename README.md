# Participation-Manager

## What is FRC Participation Manager?

This project is a RaspberryPi-based system designed to log hours for [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) participants. It includes code that runs on Raspberry Pi (or similar device) to facilitate the physical action of logging in as well as a web interface for members of a team to view their hour contributions. Through the use of this system, FRC teams can improve their sign-in process and generate useful data insights for team management. This device is intended to help growing teams accommodate for increasing team sizes while also improving their experience all around. In the end, teams should be able to use quantitative data

## Features

* Users can scan a QR or Barcode to sign in and out of meetings via a camera on the device
* Users are able to log into the web application to view their hours
* Admins are able to view everyone's hours on the web app
* Super Admins are able to modify users and their data
* Users are able to determine if their login was successful via an LCD screen

## Future improvements should be implemented if time permits

* A way to add a user via the web application
* An easy way to create ID cards from the web application
* Improved data tracking and better graphics and analysis tools for the web application
